    question: "Is this a workout?",

              <p>Meditation doesn't have to be perfectly still. In fact, sometimes the best way to get out of our heads is to get into our bodies. Zen practice often includes walking meditation (kinhin) for this very reason. Mindful movement is about bringing a curious, non-judgmental awareness to simple physical actions.</p>
              <p>This tool is for you if:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You feel restless or fidgety when trying to sit still.</li>
                <li>You spend a lot of time sitting and want a quick way to break up your day.</li>
                <li>You want to feel more connected and 'at home' in your own body.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Click the button for a simple prompt. There's no need to perform it perfectly. Just move, breathe, and notice. That's the entire practice.</p>
