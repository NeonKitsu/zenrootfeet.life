    answer: "Whenever you feel stressed or just need a moment of calm. Even 1-2 minutes a day can make a big difference. I try to do it before a big meeting or after a long day."
  },

    question: "Is it okay if I can't hold my breath for 4 seconds?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Don't force it. The numbers are just a guide. Adjust the timing to what feels comfortable for you. The goal is relaxation, not a breathing competition."

              <p>I discovered box breathing during a particularly stressful time, and it was a game-changer. The technique is simple: you breathe in, hold, breathe out, and hold again, all for the same amount of time. This simple rhythm can help regulate your autonomic nervous system, pulling you out of a "fight-or-flight" state and into a "rest-and-digest" mode.</p>
              <p>This tool is for anyone and everyone:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Feeling anxious or overwhelmed? Give this a try.</li>
                <li>Need to focus before a big task? A few rounds can clear your head.</li>
                <li>Struggling to fall asleep? This can help calm a racing mind.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>There's no magic, just the simple, profound power of your own breath. I hope it brings you a moment of peace.</p>
