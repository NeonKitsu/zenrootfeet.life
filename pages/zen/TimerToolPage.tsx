    question: "Why use a timer? Isn't that distracting?",
    answer: "It can seem that way, but for me, setting a timer is an act of commitment. It frees my mind from wondering 'how long has it been?'. I set it, forget it, and just sit. It creates a defined space for my practice."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I can't sit still for 5 minutes?",
    answer: "Start with 1 minute! Or even 30 seconds. The goal isn't to hit a number, it's to practice showing up for yourself. Be kind, start small, and celebrate that you did it at all."
  },
  {
    question: "Should my eyes be open or closed?",
    answer: "Whatever feels most comfortable and least distracting for you. Many people close their eyes to reduce visual input. I sometimes prefer a 'soft gaze' at the floor a few feet in front of me."

              <p>I wanted a meditation timer that did one thing: time my meditation. No guided tracks, no distracting bells and whistles, just a simple, reliable countdown. So, I built this.</p>
              <p>This timer is for you if:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You want to build a consistent meditation habit.</li>
                <li>You find other meditation apps too cluttered or distracting.</li>
                <li>You simply need to set aside a specific amount of time to sit quietly and be with your thoughts.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Just choose your duration, hit start, and give yourself the gift of stillness. You've earned it.</p>
