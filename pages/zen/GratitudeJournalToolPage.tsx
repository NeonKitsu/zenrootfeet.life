              <p>It's easy to get caught up in what's wrong with the world or our lives. A gratitude practice is a simple but powerful antidote. By intentionally shifting our focus to what we're thankful for, we can actively rewire our brains to notice more of the good that's already around us. It's not about ignoring the bad; it's about balancing the scales.</p>
              <p>This tool is for you if:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>You want to cultivate a more positive and optimistic mindset.</li>
                <li>You're looking for a simple, quick daily practice to improve your mental well-being.</li>
                <li>You need a tool to help you find perspective on difficult days.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Use the prompt or write whatever comes to mind. Your entries are saved in your browser, for your eyes only. I hope it brings a little more light to your day.</p>
