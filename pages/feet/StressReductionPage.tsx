              <p className="text-xl text-stone-600 !mt-2">It sounds weird, but trust me, your mind and your feet are connected.</p>
            </header>
            
            <p>For the longest time, I saw my body as a machine. If my foot hurt, I figured it was a mechanical problemâ€”bad shoes, a pulled muscle, etc. I never considered that my frantic, stressed-out mind could be making things worse. It turns out, stress can have a huge impact on our physical body, including our feet.</p>
            
            <h2>The Stress-Pain Cycle</h2>
            <p>When we're stressed, our bodies tense up. Shoulders creep up to our ears, we clench our jaw, and yes, we even tense the muscles in our feet. I noticed I would curl my toes without even realizing it when I was working on a deadline. This constant, low-level tension can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Muscle fatigue and pain:</strong> Constantly tense muscles get tired and sore.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggravated conditions:</strong> If you already have something like plantar fasciitis, stress-induced tension can make it flare up.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Chronic stress is linked to increased inflammation throughout the body, which can worsen any existing aches and pains.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mindfulness as a Foot Care Tool</h2>
            <p>So, what can we do? This is where my "Zen" and "Feet" worlds collided. Practices that reduce overall stress can have a direct, positive impact on foot health.</p>
            
            <h3>Body Scan Meditation</h3>
            <p>A simple body scan was a revelation for me. By mentally checking in with each part of my body, I became aware of the tension I was holding in my feet and legs. Just noticing it was the first step to letting it go. You can find guided versions online, or just lie down and mentally scan from your toes to your head, consciously relaxing each part.</p>

            <h3>Mindful Walking</h3>
            <p>Instead of just rushing from A to B, try a mindful walk. Pay attention to the sensation of your feet hitting the ground. Notice the roll from your heel to your toe. It turns a mundane activity into a meditative practice and helps you connect with your body's foundation.</p>

            <p>By treating my stress, I was indirectly treating my foot pain. It's a powerful reminder that we're not just a collection of parts; we're a whole, interconnected system.</p>
