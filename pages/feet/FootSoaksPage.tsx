            <p>There are few things more comforting than a warm foot soak after a long day. It feels like a full-body sigh of relief. Creating a foot soak is a simple, beautiful ritual of self-care. Here are a few of my favorite simple recipes and ideas.</p>
            
            <h2>Classic Epsom Salt Soak</h2>
            <p>Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) is famed for its ability to soothe sore muscles and reduce swelling. It's my go-to after a long hike or a day spent on my feet.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recipe:</strong> Add 1/2 cup of Epsom salt to a basin of warm water. Stir to dissolve.</li>
                <li><strong>Ritual:</strong> Soak your feet for 15-20 minutes. Close your eyes, listen to some calming music, and just relax.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>DIY Exfoliating Foot Scrub</h2>
            <p>Slough off dry skin and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth with this incredibly simple scrub.</p>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Recipe:</strong> Mix 1/2 cup of coarse sea salt or sugar with 1/4 cup of coconut or olive oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Ritual:</strong> After soaking, gently massage the scrub all over your feet, focusing on rough areas like heels. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Your feet will feel brand new.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Essential Oil Infusions (With Caution!)</h2>
            <div className="bg-yellow-100 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 text-yellow-700 p-4 my-6" role="alert">
                <p className="font-bold">Important Safety Note!</p>
                <p>Essential oils are potent. <strong>Never</strong> add them directly to water, as they won't dissolve and can burn your skin. Always dilute them in a carrier substance first, like Epsom salt or a tablespoon of carrier oil (coconut, jojoba, etc.) before adding to your soak.</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Relaxation:</strong> Mix 5-7 drops of Lavender oil with your Epsom salts before adding to the water.</li>
                <li><strong>For Invigoration:</strong> Mix 5-7 drops of Peppermint oil with salts for a cooling, energizing soak (great for tired, hot feet).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Use Heat vs. Cold</h2>
            <p><strong>Use a warm soak</strong> for general relaxation, soothing tired muscles, and softening skin. <strong>Use a cool or cold soak</strong> to reduce swelling and inflammation, especially after an injury or a very long, hot day.</p>
            <p>Enjoy these simple rituals. They are a wonderful way to thank your feet for all the hard work they do.</p>
