            <p>After a bad ankle sprain, I thought resting it was enough. But the pain and instability lingered. My doctor referred me to a physical therapist (PT), and it was a revelation. A PT doesn't just treat the injury; they treat the movement patterns that may have contributed to it.</p>
            
            <h2>Rehabilitation for Injuries</h2>
            <p>This is a core part of what PTs do. For common foot and ankle issues like sprains, strains, plantar fasciitis, or post-fracture recovery, a PT will create a tailored plan to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce pain and swelling.</li>
                <li>Restore range of motion through specific movements and stretches.</li>
                <li>Gradually rebuild strength in the muscles supporting the foot and ankle.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gait Analysis & Correction</h2>
            <p>Similar to a podiatrist, a PT will often analyze how you walk (your gait). They look for subtle issues in your stride that could be putting excess stress on parts of your feet, ankles, or even knees. They can then prescribe exercises to correct these patterns and help you move more efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Strength & Balance Training</h2>
            <p>This was the key for my recovery. I learned that my ankle wasn't just weak, my balance and proprioception (my body's sense of where it is in space) were off. A PT will prescribe specific exercises to challenge and improve your balance and strengthen the small stabilizing muscles in your feet and lower legs, which is crucial for preventing future injuries.</p>

            <h2>Manual Therapy</h2>
            <p>This is the hands-on part of PT. A therapist might use techniques like targeted massage, joint mobilization, or other methods to manually improve mobility, reduce scar tissue, and relieve pain in the soft tissues and joints.</p>

            <p>If you're dealing with a nagging foot or ankle injury, don't just 'wait it out' like I did. Consulting a physical therapist can provide you with a clear, active path to recovery and give you the tools to build a more resilient foundation.</p>
