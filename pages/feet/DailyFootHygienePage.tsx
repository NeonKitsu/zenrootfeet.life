              <p className="text-xl text-stone-600 !mt-2">It sounds basic, but you'd be surprised how much these little things matter.</p>
            </header>
            
            <p>I used to be so neglectful of my feet. They were just the things at the end of my legs that got me places. But after a bout of annoying foot pain, I realized I had to start paying attention. These simple daily habits made all the difference, and now they're a non-negotiable part of my routine.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Wash and Dry Like You Mean It</h2>
            <p>Every day, give your feet a good wash with mild soap and warm water. But the most crucial part? Drying them completely. Especially between the toes! That little bit of leftover dampness is a paradise for fungus. I make a point to take an extra 30 seconds to dry thoroughly.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Moisturize, But Not Everywhere</h2>
            <p>If you have dry, cracking heels like I did, a good moisturizer is your best friend. Apply it to the tops and bottoms of your feet, but avoid the areas between your toes to prevent moisture buildup.</p>

            <h2>3. Let Them Breathe</h2>
            <p>Whenever you're at home, kick off your shoes and socks and let your feet air out. It feels amazing and helps keep them dry and healthy. This simple act feels like a 'thank you' to my feet after a long day in shoes.</p>

            <h2>4. A Quick Daily Check-In</h2>
            <p>Take 10 seconds to look over your feet. Check for any cuts, blisters, redness, or swelling. Catching a small issue early is so much easier than dealing with a big one later. It's how I noticed a tiny cut before it got infected.</p>

            <p>That's it! It's not complicated. It's just about giving your foundation the consistent, loving care it deserves.</p>
