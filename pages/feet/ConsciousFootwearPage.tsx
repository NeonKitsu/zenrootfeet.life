            </header>
            
            <p>I spent years cramming my feet into shoes that were fashionable but terrible for meâ€”narrow, stiff, with elevated heels. I thought foot pain was just a normal part of life. Learning to choose shoes consciously was a game-changer not just for my feet, but for my knees and back, too.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Finding Your True Fit</h2>
            <p>Many of us are wearing the wrong size shoe. Our feet can change size and shape over time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shop in the afternoon:</strong> Your feet naturally swell throughout the day. Shopping later ensures you don't buy shoes that are too tight.</li>
                <li><strong>Leave some space:</strong> You should have about a half-inch (a thumb's width) of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe.</li>
                <li><strong>Width matters:</strong> Your foot shouldn't be bulging over the sides of the sole. If it is, the shoe is too narrow.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. The Case for a Wide Toe Box</h2>
            <p>Modern shoes are often tapered at the front, which squishes our toes together. This can lead to bunions, hammertoes, and other issues. A foot-shaped shoe with a wide toe box allows your toes to splay naturally, providing a wider, more stable base for your body.</p>
            <p>Look for shoes described as having a "foot-shaped" or "anatomical" toe box. This was the single biggest change I made, and it made a world of difference.</p>

            <h2>3. Material Matters: Let Your Feet Breathe</h2>
            <p>Your feet have a high concentration of sweat glands. Shoes made from synthetic, non-breathable materials trap moisture, creating a perfect environment for fungus and bacteria. Look for shoes made from natural materials like leather, canvas, or wool, or modern breathable synthetics.</p>

            <h2>4. When to Say Goodbye to Old Shoes</h2>
            <p>Even the best shoes wear out. The cushioning and support break down over time, which can lead to injury. Look for these signs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uneven tread wear:</strong> Look at the soles. Are they worn down significantly more in one area?</li>
                <li><strong>Wrinkled midsoles:</strong> The midsole is the cushioning layer. If it looks compressed and full of wrinkles, it's likely lost its shock absorption.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of support:</strong> If the shoe easily twists or folds, it's no longer providing adequate support.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choosing footwear is an act of self-care. By giving your feet the space and support they need, you're building a healthier foundation from the ground up.</p>
